**A)** Write a **small pet project** to get into coding again. You might want to use a language like Python which is also good for this Master! The code can be relatively simple (e.g. simple game with console output). This doc can be very short! (in contrast to the one below)

B) Make sure each person has applied the following **Software Engineering** topics on the code which have been taught in the lecture:

**1.** Use and understand **Git**! (Play with Branches and undo/revert things = go back in time!)

**2.** **UML** at least **3** good different big diagrams. "good" means you can pump it up artificially as written in DDD. You have 10 million $ from me! Please export the pics. I can not install all the tools to view them! Perfect would be 1) one dynamic diagram like an activity diagram 2) one or two static diagrams as component, class or deployment and if needed a use-case diagram.

**3.** Describe your project or any project (e.g. one related to your work or a private project) neatly using the methods of **Requirements Engineering** by mapping some requirements in **2 tools** (!).To do this, use the most important description attributes from the script! Approximately 5-10 requirements per tool should be sufficient. Two variants should be provided = tools. A 'self-made' version and a professional = possibly commercial version, i.e. with 2 tools! Examples of 'self-made' variants: Airtable, notion.so, Trello, etc. Examples of commercial tools: Monday, Jira, Doors, ObjectIF, Xebrio, etc. (see Miro). Instead of the professional version, you can also build a tool yourself.

**4.** From all the points in the **Analysis** learning unit, **A)** come up with your own **checklist** (on an extra DIN A4 page) with the points that you consider relevant to your project. **B.** Carry out an **analysis** of your semester project/your favourite / start-up idea and would like to submit this analysis as part of a large documentary! Write enough about each point to create at least 2 pages. Assume that you will soon have an angel for the start-up chapter. If successful, you would get a lot of “money” to be able to do the design and implement it later. So get your start-up successfully into the race!

**5.** DDD Do a **DDD** session to find your domains! If your domain is too small, invent other domains around and document these domains (as if you have 100 Mio € from Edlich-Investment!) Develop a clear strategic design with mappings/relationships with >=8 Domains coming from an **A)** visual **Event Storming**. Drop your **Domains** into the **B)** **Core Domain Chart** and draw the *C)* **Context Mappings** between the Domains!  (check the miro boards for this!)

**6.** Metrics at least two. Sonarcube would be great. Other non-trivial metrics are also fine.

**7.** Clean Code Development: **A)** At least **5 points** you can show me with an explanation of why this is clean code in your code and/or what has improved & **B)** >>10 points on your personal **CCD cheat sheet**. E.g. a PDF.

**8.** **Build Management** with any Build System as Ant, Maven, Gradle, etc. (only Travis is perhaps not enough) Do e.g. generate Docs, call tests, etc. (it could be also disconnected from the project just to learn a build tool!) and **CICD**

**9.** Integrate some (>>2) nice **unit tests** in your Code to be integrated into the Build

**10.** Use a good IDE and get fluent with it: e.g. IntelliJ. What are your favourite key shortcuts?!

**11.** Functional Programming: prove that you have covered all functional aspects in your code as:
only final data structures
* side-effect-free functions
* the use of higher-order functions
* functions as parameters and return values
* use closures / anonymous functions
You can also do it outside of your project / code. Even in other languages such as F#, Clojure, Julia, etc.
Best would be a short description and 5 links into the code to see it!

**12.** Create your own **DSL**. Give me a link to the code.

The complete documentation must be found in a public GitHub or the system you use. 

Please give me a hint as a checklist for each 1-12 numbered points (!) where I can find the info as in the README.md!!

It must explain also part B in 1-2 paragraphs per point! So list the 12 points here using links here to refer to the respective files (e.g. the CCD files or test files)!

The contribution in Moodle is just a Link to GitHub in the comment section!

And: I do not want to receive 50 invitations to your repo, because your repo is private! Make it public and close it a few days after the grading! (see FAQ)

Another final remark: Mostly, I want **your personal experiences** with Screenshots and personal text!
Please do **not** write or generate ChatGPT content like "a DSL is blah blah blah, Build Management is blah blah blah...".
This is not needed, and LLM / internet-generated content will result in failing the course!
