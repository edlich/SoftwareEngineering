## LEARNING GOALS

After UML and the methodology of the analysis and design cycle were introduced in the previous learning units, it is now a matter of taking this knowledge into account in a good architecture and thus gaining general architecture know-how.

Such knowledge can mainly only be acquired in practice and in discussions with colleagues, professionals or the lecturer.

This learning unit is intended to lay a foundation for practical work and discussions by:

* Techniques, areas and procedures are explained.
* You will learn about terms used in software architecture.
* The importance of design patterns technology architectures /
Learn about architectural styles and design patterns in software architecture. (e.g. **Enterprise Design Patterns**)

In this learning unit, you as a prospective architect will be asked to create a kind of “Swiss knife” in the form of a checklist. This learning unit contains dozens of perspectives, tools, principles, levels, design patterns, architectures, etc., all of which form **the basis for an understanding of architecture**. Each individual may not be particularly exciting. But **taken as a whole, all the points together** make up an architecture portfolio.

**TIME SCOPE**

You will need 120 minutes to complete this learning unit.

Approximately 2 hours are allocated for developing, presenting and discussing your own rudimentary software architecture.
