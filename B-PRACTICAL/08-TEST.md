## OVERIVEW AND GOALS

One of the most important topics in software engineering is the quality assurance of the software being developed. A testing culture in larger software projects is essential. Automated test runs have become an integral part of continuous integration. Testing is carried out automatically and asynchronously across all test levels, independent of the developer's time.

**LEARNING GOALS**

> The aim of this learning unit is to introduce the way of thinking about testing and to get to know the corresponding tools that can sometimes make testing fun.

> It is important that you try out the testing tools yourself, at the same time make them your own and use them in practice! Force yourself to code test-first. This is an important experience that every software engineer should have.

**OUTLINE**

This learning unit contains the following topics:

* Basics and terms on the subject of testing
* Practical testing and tools
* Code Coverage
* Mock objects
* Test Driven Development (TDD)
* TIME SCOPE

TIME NEEDED: You will need around 120 minutes to work through the learning unit and around 60 minutes to complete the exercises.
