## OVERVIEW

The “Software Metrics” learning unit is a supplement to the topic of software quality, which also includes the “Testing” learning unit. It's about making a lack of software quality or software complexity visible. Rule violations or problems in the code are listed and optimally visualized. With this help, developers, architects or project managers can better set the course for new quality.

**LEARNING GOALS**

This session has the following objectives:

You will learn about the importance of metrics as a measure of quality and how you can evaluate them in practice.
You will learn the basics and how to calculate them.
You'll learn about code metrics and how to use the tools.
You will learn about architectural metrics and use tools to visualize them.

**OUTLINE**

After a brief introduction to metrics, simple metrics such as the McCabe metrics will be covered first. After the Halstead metrics and code coverage, we discuss the different types of rule violations that many tools aggregate as metrics.
In the second part, JDepend, coupling metrics and the question of debt - the technical debt - follow.
Finally, currently available tools for Java are listed and compared.

**TIME SCOPE**

It takes approximately 120 minutes to complete this unit. Applying a complex tool like SonarQube to an existing project takes about an hour. Simple tools, such as those often integrated into IDEs or DVCS, are much quicker to use.
