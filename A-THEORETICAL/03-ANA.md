# THE ANALYSIS

(C) Prof. Dr. Stefan Edlich

---

## OVERVIEW

**LEARNING GOALS**

First of all, all essential aspects of the analysis phase should be presented. They should understand which stages and tasks there are in the analysis phase and what has to be done at the beginning and at the end of the analysis. You should be able to classify functional and requirement specifications as well as use cases and requirements.

As an exercise, you will put together your own concept of an analysis

You should then be able to present your own concept in a discussion with the course supervisor and thus deepen your knowledge and application.

The points of analysis presented in the learning unit must therefore be compiled into a separate concept and validated by yourself.

**TIME NEEDED**

You will need 2 hours to actively read this unit.

You need at least 4-5 hours to set up and apply your own analysis.

## The Complete Stages of the Analysis


This lesson is not strictly about all points of analysis. In addition to the classic tasks of analysis, there are other important points that should be considered during the analysis, generally in the early phases. This also includes considerations regarding the process model, project management or project calculation. Nvertheless this is a comprehensive list:

**Pic**: Elements of the Analysis Phase

**INITIAL PHASE**

As already mentioned, in the initial phase there are:

* description of the initial situation
* resource planning (human, financial, temporal and technical)
* first project planning
* project calculation with an effort estimation (there are many methods like analogy method, relation method, multiplier method, weighting method, method of parametric equations, percentage method, etc. which can be looked up easily.
* the overall organization of the project and the process model

**DISCRIMINATION IN ANALYSIS**

All points divided in the analysis are divided into:

* The problem analysis / business process analysis, which is often also referred to as the current state analysis, primarily considers the present.
* The TARGET concept of the analysis phase, on the other hand, looks at the future and provides information about what is to be developed.

Everything that describes the future product in the early phases or analysis phases is summarized under the generic term **product definition**. This can be the requirements specification (or a part of it), requirements, GUIs, business classes, etc.

## Company Goals

The corporate goals are clearly defined by the questions, what does the company want to achieve (with the product)? It should be noted that it can be either an external or in-house product that is being sold.

**Corporate Goal**

* more profit
* increase market share
* improve internal data flow
* better contact with customers
* higher sales

**Market Analysis**

* what is the market like? 
* can the goal be achieved?
* who are the main competitors?
* how to position yourself?
* are there already products on the market?
* goals often blur or change over time—even during development.
