## OVERVIEW

Process models are comparable to a bird's eye view. They provide a helpful overview of the entire project. After the "what" has been clarified, the "how" must be dealt with, more precisely, how should the project be organized and how should the general procedure be carried out. The question should also be answered: "What do we do when?" It is usually determined in which time, which resources do which work and which artifacts (e.g. documents or programs) are to be created.

Process models can be divided into the categories "old", "heavyweight" and "agile".

* **Old** process models have almost only historical value.
* Rather **heavyweight** process models also have a longer history and have - more or less - been updated in terms of agility.
* **Agile models** - agile in this context stands for something mobile, lively, or nimble.

This learning unit serves as an introduction, relevant terms are clarified and models are related to each other. The handling and use of process models in current projects is part of this learning unit.

Practical experience with process or agile models is advantageous and forms a good knowledge base for in-depth study. It is therefore advisable to document procedures or good ideas in your own software or exercise projects and to use them. In this way, one gains experience of how process models can be used most skilfully and most appropriately!

## LEARNING GOALS

At the beginning, terms for process models and essential elements are presented. These are rounded off by a subsequent look at history.

This is followed by waterfall and spiral models as well as the characteristics of agile models.

Finally, the lighter and agile models are considered. XP is presented in more detail, Crystal Clear and SCRUM can only be briefly touched upon.

##  TIME NEEDED

You will need approx. 180 minutes to work through the learning unit and approx. 130 minutes to complete the exercises.

## WHAT ARE PROCESS MODELS?

With the help of process models, the following questions should be answered in software engineering:

* What **parts** can the process be broken down into?
* In what **order** can the sub-steps be carried out?
* What **resources** (people, information) are required?
* What **information** must be available as input variables?
* Which **results** are generated by which sub-steps?
* Which **modeling technique** is useful for which process control steps?

The latter is particularly important in the OO context, because some projects require specific attention to creating reusable code and components. In other projects, on the other hand – e.g. B. in projects with functional programming languages - this is less important.

## TERMS: PROCEDURE MODEL AND PROCESS GUIDE

When considering the terms process model and process guide must be distinguished.

The process model is the abstract and superordinate answer to the questions of what, how and with what is to be carried out. Let's look at a definition:

> DEFINITION: process model

> "A **process model** divides the process of organizing into different, structured phases, which in turn are assigned corresponding organizational methods and techniques. The task of a process model is to present the tasks and activities that generally occur in a design process in their logical order.”

[...]

> “What all process models have in common is the **step-by-step path** from the problem to the solution and their systematically **rational approach** (in contrast to **trial and error**, see decision-making style). The individual phases are ideal types. In practice, it is often necessary to proceed iteratively and 'jump back'. Phase-oriented milestones are designed to minimize the risk and cost of failure.”

**PROCESS MODEL**

A process model is often spoken of in a slightly different context, which refers more to a technical description of business processes. Applied to the procedure for creating software within a project, a process model describes the steps and activities that occur in the project. It does not describe the business processes in the classic sense of a "company business".

**PROCESS GUIDE**

If you continue to look at the procedure in the software project, the process guide is a document that is derived from the process model and adapted. It provides concrete steps and instructions for the project, whereas the process model remains rather abstract.

A typical process at the start of a project is to set up and specify the procedure model in such a way that it fits - of course in relation to the company and the problem to be solved. This process is called "**tailoring**". The process model or models are tailor-made - the right things are taken out and adapted to the project.
