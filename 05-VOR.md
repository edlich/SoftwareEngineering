# PROCESS MODELS

(C) Prof. Dr. Stefan Edlich

## OVERVIEW

Process models are comparable to a bird's eye view. They provide a helpful overview of the entire project. After the "what" has been clarified, the "how" must be dealt with, more precisely, how should the project be organized and how should the general procedure be carried out. The question should also be answered: "What do we do when?" It is usually determined in which time, which resources do which work and which artifacts (e.g. documents or programs) are to be created.

Process models can be divided into the categories "old", "heavyweight" and "agile".

* **Old** process models have almost only historical value.
* Rather **heavyweight** process models also have a longer history and have - more or less - been updated in terms of agility.
* **Agile models** - agile in this context stands for something mobile, lively, or nimble.

This learning unit serves as an introduction, relevant terms are clarified and models are related to each other. The handling and use of process models in current projects is part of this learning unit.

Practical experience with procedural or agile models is advantageous and forms a good knowledge base for in-depth study. It is therefore advisable to document procedures or good ideas in your own software or exercise projects and to use them. In this way, one gains experience of how procedural models can be used most skilfully and most appropriately!

## LEARNING GOALS

At the beginning, terms for process models and essential elements are presented. These are rounded off by a subsequent look at history.

This is followed by waterfall and spiral models as well as the characteristics of agile models.

Finally, the lighter and agile models are considered. XP is presented in more detail, Crystal Clear and SCRUM can only be briefly touched upon.

##  TIME NEEDED

You will need approx. 180 minutes to work through the learning unit and approx. 130 minutes to complete the exercises.
